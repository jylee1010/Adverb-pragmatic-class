differently,1,that golf ball under your eye suggests <t>differently</t>.,manner,,,?,,"Okay, let's tackle this. The adverb in question is ""hoarsely,"" and the sentence is ""hoarsely car, call gina linetti."" Wait, that sentence doesn't make much sense. Maybe there's a typo or missing words? Let me think. If the sentence is supposed to be something like ""He spoke hoarsely, calling Gina Linetti,"" then ""hoarsely"" would describe the manner in which he spoke. But the original input is a bit unclear. Assuming the intended sentence is something like ""He spoke hoarsely,"" then ""hoarsely"" would be a manner adverb because it describes how the speaking was done. Alternatively, if the sentence is ""Hoarsely, he called Gina Linetti,"" then it might be subject-oriented, but that's less likely. Given the ambiguity, but based on the example where ""stupidly"" was manner, I think ""hoarsely"" here is describing the manner of the action, so adverb.manner."
